<p>The most common retort to those who suggest to create an anarchist community is "Do you know Roses' Island story? Do you know Waco?" or "The community would be bombed by the state."
These retorts emerge from a misinterpretation of the nature of the state. </p>

		<h3>"Big state eats small state"</h3>.

<p>The state is not the monopoly on violence. The state is the belief in people's minds that someone can have the right to commit crimes legally. Monopoly on violence is a necessary but absolutely not sufficient feature to allow the state to function.
On the contrary, the monopoly on violence is absolutely useless against a community that does not recognize a certain authority. That's also why nation states formed. There are about 200 states in the world. If "big state eats small state" were an unavoidable dynamic inherent to human society we would have had an all-powerful planetary government already. Why doesn't that happen? Because large populations, sharing the same culture, do not recognize external authority and tend to make enforcement too costly for outsiders while making it profitable for mobs that are instead recognized as legitimate. In fact, very often states prefer to subjugate other states by getting friendly politicians elected through media propaganda rather than impose themselves by force. The democratic process serves to legitimize aggression in the eyes of the victims themselves, who will then no longer perceive it as such. If there is no aggression, there is no reason to rebel, right?"<br><br>
But even when states impose themselves by force, it is always the state system that makes it possible for them to do so. What do armies do? What is their purpose? The goal of armies is to push the enemy's policy makers to take specific actions or give up power completely. How?
The army tries to cause enough destruction and impoverishment to push the enemy government to accomodate its requests, or it occupies the palaces of power and installs a new government, to then issue laws that are obeyed by the people.<br><br>
It is an extremely weak system precisely because of the statist population's mindset. It is so weak that it borders on ridiculous: the fate of millions and millions of people, spread over thousands of square miles, depends on what, a specific person, called the "head of government," declares in a specific building, called the "government building". To add absurdity to absurdity, the same statist who, inside that imaginary line called "border", feels obliged to obey the politician, an inch outside it would feel free not to.<br><br>
It is therefore crucial to distinguish the violence of the military in a war context from that of policemen in a peaceful context. The job of the military is different from the job of a policeman. Military's job is to force politics. Policeman's job is to enforce laws on the population. The military may also have, at certain junctures, the role of a policeman but always for a limited time that is aimed at achieving a peaceful situation in which the real police can safely carry on laws enforcement.<br><br>
An anarchist community that found itself with the military at its doorstep could quietly declare itself defeated, obey for a while so as to return to a peaceful and regular life, and then begin to disobey again. But as we shall see, the moment a community finds the military at its doorstep it means that it has already made some mistake.</p>

<h3>Stealth approach</h3>.

<p>An anarchist community has no political representatives, no government buildings. It does not appear out of nowhere shouting to the four winds that it does not recognize the authority of the host state and is ready to fight to defeat the enemy army. Anarchy is formed organically, bottom-up and quietly, especially in the beginning.
Suppose that within a year or two, 500 anarchists move to a sparsely populated town.<br><br>
Moving to a small town is not a crime, and virtually no state would attack these people for moving to the same small town. Most likely the state would not even know that these people are anarchists. They would then live in a peaceful environment, they would not have military bombing them. They would continue to live their lives quietly and peacefully. The law enforcement agencies they would interact with would be policemen intent on enforcing the law. Not military men intent on killing them.<br><br>
The goal, then, is not to come to a head-on clash with the state and win it. On the contrary, the moment an explicit head-on clash takes place, it means that the community has gone too far.<br><br>
The goal is to make law enforcement sufficiently uneconomic to disincentivize, neutralize, and weaken policing in everyday life and in the long run, but without attracting too much attention. The level of freedom a small community can take depends on how many inhabitants it has and how sophisticated its defense systems are. It is important that community members disobey the state in proportion to the capacity the community has, to protect itself at that particular moment of development.
</p>

<h3>Small Communities</h3>

<p>Someone sets up a heroin production lab or marijuana plantation in a small town of 30 people. 300 policemen arrive to arrest him and inspect everyone. The community won't be able to do anything about it of course.
A policeman from outside a community of 100 inhabitants enters the village and sees that no one is complying with distancing and masking. If he tries to say anything to someone on the street he is kicked out in a bad way. Or that arrasted person puts the mask on and then takes it off a second later. Enforcement of these kinds of small laws is virtually impossible.<br><br>
In a true anarchist society, crime would be thwarted through insurance schemes. Since the state is nothing but a criminal gang, an anarchist village could make insurance services to reimburse people who are attacked by the state.
The state threatens a shopkeeper who did not make a receipt. The shopkeeper is insured, so the evasion fine is paid by the insurance company.
The insurance company will have the incentive to defend its policyholders because every time someone is extorted, the insurance company loses money to reimburse them.<br><br>
An anarchist village of 2,000 inhabitants, could create fake birth certificates, fake death certificates, could fail to declare the dead. Residents could register property to nonexistent or dead people. A policeman would have to investigate for months and months to verify the most basic information, and then if something doesn't add up no one is guilty because everyone is covering each other's asses. Imagine how much law enforcement would be slowed down and weakened if residents punctured the wheels of police cars every time they saw one parked.<br><br>
They could deed property to the municipality so as not to pay taxes. Actual ownership would be established by the relationships among community members while in the eyes of the state it would all turn out to be municipality's property. A communist dream in the eye of the government.
The state could also place the municipality under receivership, it is irrelevant. The municipality or police barracks could wretchedly catch fire strucked by a lightning, they could constantly run out of power because of problems with the electrical system, they could have problems with smelly canisters, problems with invasions by rats or other animals. They could be sent into a tailspin by clogging up systems with requests, for example, by constantly calling the police to report nonexistent crimes.<br><br>
Of course, the whole village is anarchic and everyone would be looking out for each other's asses in case of trials and the like.
Even supposing someone were convicted and imprisoned for some "crime", it would not be the end of the community; after all, an anarchist community is decentralized. There is no political leader on whom everyone else depends on.<br><br>
Ways to make state extortion anti-economical, without incurring its violent wrath, are innumerable. There's no need to have special weapons or training, no need to declare war, no need to declare anything, making life impossible for public employees is enough. In fact, direct violent actions are the best way to fail.
The community could use Bitcoin and a thousand other systems to protect its wealth, but there is no need for everyone to violate state law; rather, each individual can determine how much risk to take, how much to evade, which laws to ignore and which to abide by, etc. He will do so with the knowledge that his community represents a certain level of protection. At an early stage where the community is still vulnerable, citizens might even abide by all laws. That's ok.</p>

<h3>Big Communities</h3>

<p>Obviously at first it would not be a life without sacrifice, but if freedom did not require sacrifice we would not be slaves at the moment.
The community should slowly grow by creating businesses, exploiting black and gray markets and trying to make itself as self-sufficient as possible. Doing so is not mandatory but it would be an extra safety measure in case the state tries to retaliate against the community in some way.<br><br>
The more the community grows, the easier life becomes and the more ineffective the state becomes. If 1% of the Italian people (i.e., 600,000 people) were anarchists and lived in the same city or region, there would not be enough police officers and public employees throughout Italy to report, put before a judge and prosecute 600,000 people who do not obey the law.
Even supposing that all the policemen in Italy and the entire Italian army (300,000 people) were to organize to go from door to door to demand tax money, they would be constantly attacked by civil society.<br><br>
Even assuming they would not be attacked, just having to go door to door threatening so many citizens would be enough to make enforcement unfeasible.
Even assuming that they would be able to arrest everyone while being in a clear minority, there would not be enough prisons to house all those arrested.
Even assuming that there would be enough prisons, the state would go from attacking a productive population with the goal of "earning" money through taxes to having to keep them in prisons at its own expense, making the operation uneconomic at best as well as technically very difficult to carry out.<br><br>
This makes it clear how the state functions only because its people report and hand over their possessions to their extortionist willingly, either because they think they have to, for the common good or out of fear. This obedience inculcated from childhood drastically collapses the cost of extortion. If the state had to constantly bear the cost of active extortion, it would already be bankrupt.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Anarchy emerges bottom-up organically. One must abandon this idea that freedom can only be achieved by going through armed conflicts with the state. The state does not exist because of its weapons and you do not defeat it by having more weapons. The state exists because it is in people's heads, even in the heads of many anarchists. Making people believe that the state exists because it has a monopoly on violence, and therefore weapons, is the best way to push the rebels to engage in armed frontal confrontation. This type of confrontation is the state's preferred type of conflict because it can paint the insurgents as violent murderous criminals and can respond by killing them with the population approval.
To beat the state it is therefore necessary to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Forget statist approach to conflicts (violent and frontal)</li>.
	<li>Being astute in the ways of disobedience </li>.
	<li>Being willing to make sacrifices.</li>
</ol>
